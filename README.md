## Project Setup Guide

### Overview

This README provides the instructions necessary for setting up and running the project scripts on both Windows and macOS systems. It includes steps to run scripts that configure the environment and execute the main application.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Homebrew installed (for macOS).
- Internet connection to download necessary Python packages and setup tools.

### Setup Instructions

#### For Windows Users

1. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - Navigate to the Windows subdirectory where the `.bat` files are located.
2. **Run Setup Script**:
   - Execute `setup.bat` by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
     ```
     setup.bat
     ```
   - This script will install any required libraries and set up the necessary environment variables.
3. **Run Application**:
   - Execute `run.bat` by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
     ```
     run.bat
     ```
   - This will start the main application.

#### For macOS Users

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - Navigate to the macOS subdirectory where the `.sh` files are located.
2. **Run Setup Script**:
   - Execute `setup.sh` with the following command:
     ```
     ./setup.sh
     ```
   - This script will check for Python, install it if it's missing, and manage other dependencies.
3. **Run Application**:
   - Execute `run.sh` with the following command:
     ```
     ./run.sh
     ```
   - This will launch the main application script.

### Additional Information

- Ensure that you have write access to the installation directories and administrative privileges if needed.
- For troubleshooting, ensure all paths are set correctly according to your system's configurations.

### Formatting Text in Content

Enhance your contentâ€™s readability and visual appeal using text formatting options available in the interactive Python script:

- **Bold Text**: Highlight key phrases by enclosing text with double asterisks `**`. For example, `**bold text**` appears as **bold text**.
- **Italic Text**: Add emphasis to words or phrases by enclosing text with slashes `\i`. For example, `\iitalic text\i` renders as *italic text*.

#### Applying Text Styles:
These styles can be applied across various content types:

- **Headers**: Use bold or italic styling to emphasize specific terms or phrases. Note that headers do not have a bottom margin, allowing the text that follows to appear closely under the header.
- **Paragraphs**: Incorporate bold or italic formatting to draw attention to critical information or to emphasize certain parts of the text.
- **Lists**: Use formatting within list items to make key details stand out or to highlight aspects that need emphasis.
